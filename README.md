# DT-and-RF-Classifiers-For-Malware-in-Android-Apps.
A Comparison of Decision Trees and Random Forest Classifiers on Predicting Malware in Android Apps.

The intent of this study is to build two binary classifiers that can predict whether an Android app is considered to be malware or not based on a dataset of requested app permissions.
The classifications considered will be the Random Forest and Decision Trees algorithms. In both cases the modelâ€™s accuracy and ability to generalise will be optimised using appropriate hyperparameters.
